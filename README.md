Q LEARNING PROJECT </br>
</br>
In this section I apply Q learning technique to find the optimal way for the warehouse robot. I downloaded </br>
a warehouse picture from bird eye view and edited for this experiment. I split all potential path to sections </br>
with equal distances, and placed two products P1 and P2 on the site which the robot should collect. The robot </br>
enter the site at landmark A and leave the site through landmark X. The task is to collect the products through </br>
the shortest path between A and X. Product P1 can be collected in point N, and P2 product can be collected in </br>
point P and point L.

TWIN-DELAYED DDPG PROJECT</br>
</br>
</br>
In this project I use the leading edge Twin-delayed DDPG (deep deterministic policy gradient) model in open </br>
AI Gym environment, and check how it performs. In some open AI gym environments I couldn't create video on  </br>
robot's performance. The Twin-Delayed3 is applied to environment having a continous action space, which  </br>
means that the AI is playing some continuous actions in a range of continous values.

AB TESTING WITH THOMPSON SAMPLING</br>
</br>
In this project I am upgrading my former Webdesign A/B testing projects. Now I use Thompson sampling. I check </br>
9 different WEBDESIGNS: with a button in 9 different position ( BANNER 1, BANNER 2 etc.) to find out which </br>
provides the highest conversion rate. In this project I do the test on the fly. The metric/reward will </br>
be the click -through rate, showing how many people clicked on the banner with the button in different positions. </br>
By means of the Thompson sampling we can decide on the fly which button is more effective and produce more click </br>
through rate in the real life, saving money for the company compared to traditional A/B testing methods. Traditional</br>
A/B tests introduced in the "ML techniques in Sales and Markting" section are more time consuming and cost-intensive </br>
methods than the Thompson way, as you have to plan, execute and evaluate the test before applying the best strategy</br>
in real life, but Thompson Sampling makes all three steps possible on the fly.</br>

COST REDUCTION WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</br>
</br>
In this project I am just checking how DeepMind AI minimized a big part of Google's cost by reducing Google </br>
Data Centre Cooling Bill with using Deep Q-Learning AI model. Here I am experimenting code by Hadelin de Ponteves.</br>
