Q LEARNING PROJECT </br>
</br>
In this section I apply Q learning technique to find the optimal way for the warehouse robot. I downloaded </br>
a warehouse picture from bird eye view and edited for this experiment. I split all potential path to sections </br>
with equal distances, and placed two products P1 and P2 on the site which the robot should collect. The robot </br>
enter the site at landmark A and leave the site through landmark X. The task is to collect the products through </br>
the shortest path between A and X. Product P1 can be collected in point N, and P2 product can be collected in </br>
point P and point L.

TWIN-DELAYED DDPG PROJECT</br>
</br>
In this project I use the leading edge Twin-delayed DDPG (deep deterministic policy gradient) model in open AI Gym</br>
environment, and check how it performs. In some open AI gym environments I couldn't create video on robot' performance.</br>
The Twin-Delayed3 is applied to environment having a continous action space, which means that the AI is</br>
playing some continuous actions in a range of continous values.
